# ACNH Breeding Policies
We model the pathway to breeding target flower genotypes (or phenotypes, satisfied by having at least one of a set of genotypes) as a Markov Decision Process and derive an optimal breeding policy to achieve that target using Monte Carlo Tree Search.

## TODO
- Allow user to create breeding recipe objects using the punnett square tab of shiny app
- Add a basic simulator to experiment with policies under a more realistic ACNH game environment
- Compare and contrast commonly proposed policies to known best recipes
- Finish drafting the report related to this topic
