# ACNH Breeding Policies
We model the pathway to breeding target flower genotypes (or phenotypes, satisfied by having at least one of a set of genotypes) as a Markov Decision Process and derive an optimal breeding policy to achieve that target using Monte Carlo Tree Search.

All code and the shiny app was tested using Google Colab and ngrok

## TODO
- Make the shiny app much more presentable and user friendly
- Add a basic simulator to experiment with policies under a more realistic ACNH game environment
- Compare and contrast commonly proposed policies to known best recipes
- Finish drafting the report related to this topic
